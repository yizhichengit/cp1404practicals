### Accuracy of Estimates for Practical Tasks

At the outset, my ability to accurately estimate the time required for practical tasks was rudimentary, often optimistic. I soon learned that tasks usually take longer than first anticipated due to unforeseen complexities and issues that arise during implementation. However, as the course progressed, my estimates improved. This was a result of gaining a better understanding of the tasks at hand, becoming more familiar with common pitfalls, and learning from past experiences. Regular reflection on the reasons behind any discrepancies between estimated and actual time taken was key to this improvement.

### Learning from Code Reviews

Code reviews were instrumental in my growth as a developer. Being on the receiving end, I learned to appreciate constructive criticism and saw it as an opportunity to refine my code and to adopt best practices. Reviewing others' code, on the other hand, honed my ability to scrutinize code critically and to articulate feedback in a helpful and positive manner. It also exposed me to new approaches and coding styles. Importantly, both roles taught me the significance of clear communication and the value of diverse perspectives in collaborative projects.

### Reflection on Practical Tasks

If I were in charge of the subject, I would advocate for more pair programming tasks. Collaboration not only divides the workload but also combines diverse thought processes, which often leads to more innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, I would incorporate more real-world case studies to give practical tasks a context, making them more engaging and relevant. Lastly, incorporating iterative feedback loops within the tasks could foster a growth mindset, allowing students to iterate on their work based on constructive feedback.
